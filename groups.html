      <h1>Working Groups</h1>
      <p>Lafayette OGS operates primarily through the actions of smaller teams
        of graduate students who are focused on specific topics or initiatives,
        generally called 'working groups'. Working groups are formed by Lafayette
        OGS members when it will fill a need that the currently active working
        groups are unable to cover. They provide information about their objectives,
        notes from past meetings and upcoming meeting times below. Contact
        <a href="mailto:lafayetteogs@gmail.com">lafayetteogs@gmail.com</a> if you
        would like to learn more about a working group, get more involved in an
        active group, or start a new working group.</p>

We have also sparked university conversations around identifying mal- and disinformation. This working group primarily responds to proposed or ongoing events, either to oppose hateful actions on campus or to provide support to actions that further an inclusive and anti-hateful community.

These have included; changing i20 extension processes, improving support for incoming international students with completing required paperwork (such as creating Social Security Numbers), and improving guidance to align new international TAs to the American education system. Recently we have pursued these goals by working with Graduate Coordinators and Faculty members to set up a renewed process to improve the i20 extension process and develop better support systems for new international students. ISL was begun by members of the Biology Department but we aim to outgrow the bounds of this department and offer a platform to all international students at UL to share their concerns and find meaningful solutions.";

Graduate students flourish when their needs and interests are reflected in their departments and the only way that happens is if graduate students can speak for themselves. We focus on establishing pathways for graduate students to speak out that a) departments are accountable to and b) protect graduate students from retaliation. We recently founded a representative body of graduate students in the Biology department (BGSA), following the model of the English department (EGSA), and can provide support to any students who would like to establish a similar body in their own department. We also explore other avenues of student actions, such as open letters and faculty-student discussions.";

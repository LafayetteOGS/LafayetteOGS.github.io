      <h2>What is LOGS?</h2>
      <p>Lafayette Organized Graduate Students (Lafayette OGS or LOGS) is a
        cross-departmental group dedicated to building graduate student
        communication and allowing graduate students to support one another. Many
        sectors of UL Lafayette currently operate through informal or poorly
        documented rules with little transparency and to the detriment of
        graduate workers' experience and livelihoods. Providing a way for
        graduate students to share information and speak with a collective voice is an
        essential tool to making equitable and systemic changes in such an
        institution. As a non-university affiliated group, we provide a structure
        for graduate students to seek support from a larger community and form
        working groups to address topics which will improve accountability and
        working conditions within UL Lafayette.</p>

      <p>Lafayette OGS currently uses listserv for graduate students and
        workers to communicate about events and concerns, share questions and
        advice, and communicate about current activities and initiatives. Stay
